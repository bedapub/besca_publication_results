# Besca's publication results

This repository includes notebooks utilized to produce results for the publication on the Besca toolkit (https://github.com/bedapub/besca). Please find additional tutorials and documentation here: https://bedapub.github.io/besca/

To demonstrate how Besca can be applied to a wide variety of biological samples, we reprocessed publicly available single-cell data from ten studies:

Three datasets cover blood- and bone-marrow-derived hematopoietic cells: 
- PBMC3k (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3948150) includes healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from one donor, a reference dataset often used in single-cell tutorials based on 10X Genomics data (https://www.10xgenomics.com/).
- Granja2019 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3944753) includes bone marrow mononuclear cell (BMMCs) and PBMC samples from healthy donors (1). In addition to scRNA-seq, several protein markers were also probed by CITE-seq.
- Kotliarov2020 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3938290) includes baseline PBMC samples from healthy donors, who were high and low responders to influenza vaccines (2). In addition to scRNA-seq, a high number of protein markers were also probed by CITE-seq.

Four datasets reveal the intestinal cell composition:
- Smillie2019 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3960617) includes colon epithelium and lamina propria samples from healthy donors and ulcerative colitis patients (3).
- Martin2019 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3862132) includes ileal lamina propria samples from Crohn’s disease patients (4).
- Haber2017 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3935782) includes murine small intestine samples (5).
- Lee2020 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3967538) includes tumor and non-malignant colon samples from colorectal cancer (CRC) patients (6).

Three datasets are pancreas-derived:
- Segerstolpe2016 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3928276) includes pancreatic islet cells from healthy donors and type 2 diabetic patients (7).
- Peng2019 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3969339) includes tumor and non-malignant pancreatic samples from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and non-pancreatic tumor patients (8).
- Baron2016 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3968315) includes pancreatic samples from healthy donors (9).
